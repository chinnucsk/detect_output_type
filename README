Detect when user run with shell output or file output.
In some applications, you want to know when user run application with erlang shell
output? when with file output?
    In Ruby, you can know it by: $stdout.tty?
    In Python, you can know it by: sys.stdout.isatty()
    e.t
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run:
Before run make you must change $ERL_PATH as the path of Erlang you installed
    make compile
    make test
    make test > result.txt
    make sample
    make sample > result.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain:
    If you run: make run
    That mean you choose Erlang shell output.

    And If you run: make run > result.txt
    That mean you choose file output.

    If you run: make sample
    That mean you choose Erlang shell output.
    In the sample, output to shell "Hello world!" with red color

    If you run: make sample > result.txt
    That mean you choose Erlang file output.
    In the sample, output to file "Hello world!"
